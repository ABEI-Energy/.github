# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the Abei Energy GitHub. Here you can find quite a few things. We think that the most of you will come for two things: either you want to see the cheatsheets or maybe you want to use the scripts. Maybe even you want to code some and add to the [repositories](https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#repository). Here we explain to you how to make use of this.

First thing you need to know is that there are various [teams](https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#team) within this github _thing_. By default, you will be assigned to the general team ```@ABEI-Energy/general```. This team has only __reading__ permissions with some exceptions. You will be granted access to certain repos where you can **propose** changes, but those need to be approved by someone in another team. Like so, we allow and welcome everybody to participate and include their ideas without risking the files. If you need to enter a certain team other than the general one, read the [issues](#if-you-dont-want-to-get-your-hands-dirty) section. Go there as well if you see something odd and want to raise your hand.

## Wikis

Wikis are sort of instructions. If you want to know the workflow for a certain process done within the company, these are kind of the rules to follow. 

Under the Repositories tab, you will find all the repositories that the site hosts. 
 
![Repository tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118175657/203808037-ea339ebc-d868-4772-9b3b-a4da785d1517.png)

The ones labelled with ```wiki-```are the ones with the information aforementioned.

![Wikis-](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118175657/203818608-45cd1ac6-8742-41c7-be38-84daf1358618.png)

Once you open any of the repos, you should see something like this, one file called [README.md](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#readme)  ,and under it, the text (which is the so-called wiki).

>**Note**
>If you find other files within the ```wik-repo```, probably they shouldn't be there, maybe you are in the wrong repo, or who knows. Don't worry, you can open those files and see what's in them, check out the [glossary](https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary) if you are curious. 


### How to make a contribution?

Let's suppose that you have seen an error somewhere, or maybe you just think you may have some interesting idea or comment that could add up to the repo (it could be a new file, it could be a new section on a [README.md](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#readme), or whatever you can possibly think of).

#### Two ways to procceed
#### If you don't want to get your hands dirty

This would work as if opening a ticket. Just go to the [Issues](https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#issue) tab. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118175657/203834504-8c639074-b112-44f5-8fe3-6fd34531e3fb.png)

Once there, create a new issue clicking on the button. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118175657/203835009-b564681d-e7df-4346-80ab-e5fdc844bbc1.png)

Once opened the new issue, a text box should prompt. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118175657/203836550-266cb71c-dfd2-454b-9b39-edacefeb23d6.png)

In it, you put a title (summarising what you need) and a bigger comment section to elaborate on what you need. You can drop files of any type on the greyed out area (screenshots, pdfs, documents...). Once done, click on the "Sumbit new issue" button. From there, someone will take care of it 

#### If yoy want to (or at least try to) perform your changes. 
Go to the repositories section and choose any thereof that you may want to modify. Once there, go to the README.md file. You should be left with this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118175657/203819332-dead0e55-5082-4051-b986-238ab48956eb.png)

On the grey ribbon you can see the small symbol of a pencil. Go click on it.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118175657/203819793-0698a293-b0b2-43f2-a172-1ac0eadf9418.png)

Once you clicked, you are in the text editor. If you are familiarised with this kind of stuff, then just jump in! If not, check out this guide on [how to write in README.md files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118175657/203820024-e33241e2-7ce0-4a11-94f0-a1e26a89f87e.png)

As you may see, there is a blue text dialogue saying something about changes and whatnot. Everything is fine. It just states that you can __propose__ changes by means of a [fork](https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#fork). Basically, you just create a copy of the file to make the changes you want. This way, we protect the main wiki from unwanted changes, also allowing you to be as clumsy as you want without having to worry about anything. You can add any file you might want to the wiki page (pictures, documents, links, you name it!).

Once you have done everything you intented to do, go all the way down to the bottom of the page, where you should find this text box:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118175657/203821642-dc8da53c-c342-415d-818f-f7f5d5b4c11c.png)

This is where you ask permission to do changes. In the small header (where you can read greyed out ```Create README.md```) you have to write a concise title of what you just did, so for the reviewer to understand _in the blink of an eye_ what you did. If that is not enough, you are welcome to further explaining. Once done, click on the ```Propose changes``` button. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118175657/203827067-7042c630-631b-42a2-bf99-38b86d47eaf1.png)

Once clicked, you will be redirected to the Comparing changes section. Here, down under you can see all the changes you made. In red what was deleted, in green what was added. Furthermore, here is where you will have to create a [Pull request](https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#pull-request) which is basically to ask permission to merge your changes to the main repository.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118175657/203827971-37788fc2-2349-4db5-aaa5-04fbccea26ae.png)

If you press on the Create a pull request button, you will be greeted by the another text box, with the same header and content that you wrote one step ago.

>**Warning**
Even though when you make a Pull Request the responsible team will get notified, you can tag them like shown below. You see different teams, but usually if you are modifying wikis, go for ```@ABEI-Energy/approvals``` in case you really want to get their attention. Also you can see other useful teams like ```@ABEI-Energy/help``` where to raise your voice if something is not working as it should be (although this is more recommended to do as an [Issues](https://docs.github.com/es/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#issue) matter, as explained in [If you don't want to get your hands dirty](-If-you-don't-want-to-get-your-hands-dirty))

**And that would be it, once submitted you will have to wait for it to be reviewed. If there are comments or changes to be made to your proposal, the responsible team will notify you. If your changes are accepted, you should recieve an email saying that your changes have been approved. If not, check your notifications on the bell symbol up to the right on your GitHub session:**

## Scripts

Github is thought as a collaborative platform to code. In case you want to dig dipper on how to participate, check the repo [How to use the scripts](https://github.com/ABEI-Energy/wiki-use-the-scripts#wiki-use-the-scripts)
